Jump and Swing
==============

This mod replaces the movement mechanics of Earendel's grappling gun mod and adds a jump button. Unlike with the original grappling gun mod, with this one you can preserve your momentum and swing around. Preserving your momentum becomes a small challenge to keep movement interesting as you explore the world.

How to use
----------

To jump, you need to unlock a technology and set up a hotkey, per default, the jump hotkeys are J and Mouse Button 4. To use the grappling gun, you need to unlock another technology to get the weapon and ammunition. Hold the shooting button of the grappling gun for as long as the hook should stay active. When you release the hook, you will jump automatically. The higher technology levels upgrade the grappling gun automatically. Experiment with the keybindings, I suggest using one of the mouse buttons and the space bar for the jump button and the shooting button, so you can reach both while holding the direction keys (WASD).

Early Version
-------------

The mod is in an early stage. I am not aware of any crashes but use autosaves. Cliffs are more than slightly buggy at the moment. It is incompatible with some mods, see below. Some game mechanics might still change and performance is fine, but not perfectly optimized. Do not uninstall this mod while players are still in a floating state (jumping or hooking).

Compatibility
-------------

* Mods that enable fancy character movement are not supported at the moment.
* Mods that switch the character model in runtime are not supported. To clarify, a single mod that changes the character model is probably fine, but if you can choose the character then you will have problems.
* Mods that teleport on the same surface will be supported in the future, I suspect they mostly work, except you can get very long hooks.
* Mods that teleport to different surfaces like factorissimo 2 should be fine.
* Mods that affect movement speed of individual players are incompatible and won't be made compatible. Mods that affect the movement speed of whole forces are fine, for example qol research; mods that affect player movement through equipment or capsules are also fine.

Known incompatible:

* Jetpack
* Renai Transportation (player bouncepads, powerline hook)
* miniMaxiME
* Adaptive movement speed
* Caffeine
* RPG mods

Maybe compatible:

* Portal or Teleporters

Acknowledgements

This mod relies on graphics of the grappling gun mod and contains modified parts of the source code of the jetpack and grappling gun mod, with permission from Earendel.

Other Movement Mods
-------------------

This mod may later provide an interface so that it easier to create other movement mods while also keeping them compatible. For example sliding across ice, floating across water, gliding with a parachute, all while being able to jump, grapple etc. The interfaces are not there yet, but this may change in later releases.
