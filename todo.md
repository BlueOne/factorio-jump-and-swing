* Set up technologies for upgrades of the grappling hook
    - stat-upgrade. e.g. range 12->20, cooldown 90f->45f, duration 40 -> 60. 
    - water-upgrade: allow grapple on water
* Test collision while grapple is active, might be more fun
* only jump on ground, not on water? - setting
* Recopy the swap_character function
* Cannot float everywhere! adapt all places where this is a problem
* Move license stuff to license places.
* Better air physics (jumping up-down movement)
* Fix accuracy - can land inside inpathable tiles.
