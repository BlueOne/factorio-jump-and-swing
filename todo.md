* Crash via Hook in the middle
* no friction only when pressing direction
* bunny hopping at start is too strong
* test: friction when jumping but not when hooking

* Recopy the swap_character function
* Move license stuff to license places.
* Localization
* hints


Later-Todos
* Spammy movement - reduce number of key inputs somehow?

* Figure out factory entity collisions
* Rework cliff collisions
